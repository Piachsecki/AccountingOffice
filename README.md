## About The Project

The project was created for a Java programming classes at the Univeristy. This application is the example of how the program's backend for an accounting office might look like. Thoughout the project I have learned specific libraries, technologies and architectures.
Application was written in hexagonal-architecture and rich-domain-object model where the accountant can process CRUD operations on both customers and invoices to the database by ORM services. Eveyrything was mapped with the help of Hibernate, where methods were first built by 
from scratch and then implemented with Spring annotations.
